**A first attempt to create GAN models to generate cat images.**

**Opportunity provided by ML Seminar in Computer Science Department, FU Berlin**


### Train model

- Download dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/cat-dataset/
- unzip in project_root_directory/data

run `python train.py`

### Evaluate model based on parameters from the serialized PyTorch state dictionary

run `python evaluate.py`
